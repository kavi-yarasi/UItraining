         Idli </p>
         <p>  or idly is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in <i>  Eastern and Southern India </i>   and in <I>Sri Lanka </I>. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.
